# üîç Visual Product Search

> Enable visual search for ecommerce products using computer vision and similarity matching.

## üéØ Use Case

In today's competitive ecommerce landscape, providing intuitive ways for customers to discover products is essential. This recipe demonstrates how to use Mixpeek to:

1. **Enable image-based product search** for your ecommerce platform
2. **Identify key visual attributes** of products automatically
3. **Extract and classify product characteristics** for better matching
4. **Implement "find similar products"** functionality

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation

### Key Components

- **Product Detection**: Recognize products in images
- **Color Analysis**: Extract color profiles for matching
- **Style Classification**: Identify design elements and styles
- **Text Extraction**: Capture text visible on products
- **Visual Similarity Search**: Find visually similar products

### Code Example

```javascript
// Set up visual product search
const pipeline = new MixpeekPipeline({
  featureExtractors: [
    'product-detection',
    'color-analysis',
    'style-classification',
    'text-extraction'
  ],
  retrievers: ['visual-similarity-search']
});

// Process product images
const results = await pipeline.process(productImage);

// Find similar products
const similarProducts = await pipeline.search({
  imageQuery: userUploadedImage,
  filters: {
    category: "Furniture",
    priceRange: { min: 100, max: 500 }
  },
  limit: 10
});

// Search by extracted attributes
const blueProducts = await pipeline.search({
  filters: {
    dominantColor: "blue",
    style: "modern"
  }
});
```

## üîÑ Pipeline Flow

1. **Ingestion**: Product images are uploaded to a Mixpeek bucket
2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Product detection identifies the main item in images
   - Color analysis extracts dominant and accent colors
   - Style classification recognizes design elements
   - Text extraction captures visible text on products
3. **Indexing**: Visual features are stored in optimized feature stores
4. **Retrieval**: Products can be searched by visual similarity or extracted attributes

## üìä Business Benefits

- **Enhanced User Experience**: Allow customers to search using images instead of text
- **Increased Discoverability**: Help customers find products they can't easily describe
- **Higher Conversion Rates**: Reduce the steps between discovery and purchase
- **Competitive Advantage**: Offer modern search capabilities that meet customer expectations
