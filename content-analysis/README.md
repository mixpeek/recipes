# üìö Educational Content Analysis

> Analyze educational videos and documents to extract key concepts, generate summaries, and create interactive learning materials.

## üéØ Use Case

Educational institutions and EdTech companies need to process vast amounts of learning materials to make them more accessible and engaging. This recipe demonstrates how to use Mixpeek to:

1. **Extract key concepts** from educational videos and documents
2. **Generate concise summaries** of complex learning materials
3. **Create interactive study questions** based on content
4. **Build knowledge graphs** connecting related concepts

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation

### Key Components

- **Concept Extraction**: Identify key topics and terms
- **Summary Generation**: Create concise overviews of content
- **Question Generation**: Automatically create quiz questions
- **Knowledge Graph Builder**: Connect related concepts
- **Semantic Search**: Enable searching by concepts and meaning

### Code Example

```javascript
// Configure educational content analysis
const pipeline = new MixpeekPipeline({
  featureExtractors: [
    'concept-extraction',
    'summary-generation',
    'question-generation',
    'knowledge-graph-builder'
  ],
  retrievers: ['semantic-search']
});

// Process educational content
const results = await pipeline.process(educationalContent);

// Search for related materials by concept
const relatedMaterials = await pipeline.search({
  query: "photosynthesis cellular respiration",
  filters: {
    gradeLevel: "High School",
    subject: "Biology"
  }
});

// Generate study guide for specific topic
const studyGuide = await pipeline.generate({
  concepts: ["cellular respiration", "ATP production"],
  outputType: "studyGuide",
  includeQuestions: true
});
```

## üîÑ Pipeline Flow

1. **Ingestion**: Educational videos and documents are uploaded to a Mixpeek bucket
2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Concept extraction identifies key topics and terminology
   - Summary generation creates concise overviews
   - Question generation creates interactive learning materials
   - Knowledge graph builder connects related concepts
3. **Indexing**: Extracted features are stored in optimized feature stores
4. **Retrieval**: Content can be searched by concept, topic, or semantic meaning

## üìä Educational Benefits

- **Improved Content Discovery**: Help students find relevant learning materials
- **Enhanced Comprehension**: Provide summaries and concept maps for complex topics
- **Interactive Learning**: Automatically generate quizzes and study questions
- **Personalized Education**: Recommend materials based on student needs and interests
